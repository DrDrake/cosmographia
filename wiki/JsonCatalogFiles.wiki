#summary A description of the JSON catalog file format for Cosmographia

= Introduction =

Cosmographia's native catalog files are stored in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation.) The very simple syntax of JSON is described at http://www.json.org/

= Example =

Here's a complete catalog file containing a single object.

{{{
{
     "version": "1.0",
     "name": "Cassini Solstice Mission",

     "items" :
     [
      	{
          "name" : "Cassini",
          "center" : "Saturn",
          "trajectoryFrame" : "EclipticJ2000",
          "trajectory" :
          {
              "type" : "InterpolatedStates",
              "source" : "cassini-solstice.xyzv"
          },
          "geometry" :
          {
              "type" : "Mesh",
              "size" : "5m",
              "source" : "models/cassini.obj"
          }
        }
    ]
}
}}}

= Catalog File Properties =

 * version - version number of the catalog file (always 1.0 for now)
 * name - name of the catalog
 * items - an array of catalog file objects (for now, bodies and visualizers)

= Body properties =

A body is identified by setting the value of type to "body"; this is the value assumed when the type isn't listed, so it may be omitted.

 * name
 * center - name of the center object; the position of the body is defined relative to the center object
 * trajectoryFrame - reference frame for position
 * bodyFrame - reference frame for orientation
 * trajectory - describes the position of the object over time
 * rotationModel - describes the orientation of the object over time

*Note:* The center, frames, trajectory, and rotation model collectively comprise an _arc_. The catalog file format will soon be updated to support multiple arcs for a body.
